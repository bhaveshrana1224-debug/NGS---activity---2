Does the alignment support that this is the same gene? Answer: Yes, The sequence shows the complete identity with the alignment.

What is the biological role of this gene? Answer: Acts as the blueprint for producing seven structural proteins essential for the virus's survival, replication, and high pathogenicity. It is involved in disease. The sequence is a gene, neither prokaryotic nor eukaryotic. It is conserved across species

#FINAL CONCLUSION -
"The given unknown sequence is identified as Gene from organism EBOLA virus (CDS). BLAST analysis shows a % identity of 100 and an E-value of 4e-109 indicating a strong match".

Does the alignment support that this is the same gene? Answer: Yes, The sequence shows the complete identity with the alignment. What is the biological role of this gene? Answer: Provide instructions for making the hormone insulin, increases glucose uptake into the cell. It is involved in metabolism and also related to disease. The sequence is Gene and, the cell is Eukaryotic. It is conserved across species .

#FINAL CONCLUSION - “The given unknown sequence is identified as Gene from organism Homo sapiens . BLAST analysis shows a % identity of 100 and an E-value of 4e-120 indicating a strong match."

Does the alignment support that this is the same protein? Answer: Yes, The sequence shows the complete identity with the alignment. What is the biological role of this protein? Answer:Envelope glycoprotein gp160 is the precursor protein for HIV's outer spikes, acting as a crucial viral "key" that first binds to host cell receptors (CD4 and a coreceptor like CCR5/CXCR4) and then facilitates the fusion of the virus's membrane with the host cell, allowing the virus to enter and infect it It is involved in disease. The sequence is protein and, the cell is neither prokaryotic nor eukaryotic . It is species specific.

#FINAL CONCLUSION -
"The given unknown sequence is identified as Protein from organism Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) BLAST analysis shows a % identity of 80.43 and an E-value of 2e-44 indicating a strong match."
